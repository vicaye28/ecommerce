# E-commerce Sales

## Introduction
This is a faux dataset of part of a sales year from June to September of 2022. I also created a dataframe within Excel of targets for this sales period based on monthly totals. I wanted to clean the data and then use it to create a tableau dashboard.

## Tasks
* Import .csv file into Pandas.
* check datatypes are correct for example, dates.
* Find any missing values and replace them.
* Export out a cleaned .csv file.

## Takeaways
This was a relatively simple task as there was not much wrong with the data. The Dark Blue colour was by far the most popular by a large margin so it made for uneven-looking graphs. I guess people just love dark blue.
I decided to change the dataframe to combine some colours just to make it easier to create a target dataframe (would have been doing that for hours otherwise).

As always, it was quite fun creating a dashboard within tableau.
